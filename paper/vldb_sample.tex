\section{Eventual Serializability}
In this section, we present the formal notion of \emph{Eventual
Serializability}, \es, and intuitively argue about its usefulness. Consequently, we
will introduce our ES anomaly detection algorithm as an extension to a previously known static
analysis technique \cite{Nagar:ser}. We will finally
present a handful of canonical examples from the literature and discuss how they all
implicitly conform to our notion of correctness.

\subsection {Definitions}
In this section, we assume (for the brevity of this
write-up) the SQL language and all definitions and operational rules from \cite{Nagar:ser}
are already presented to the readers. 

Given an abstract execution $ \mex = (\mtxns, \mvis, \mar)$, where \txns is a set of 
transaction instances, $\mvis \subseteq \mtxns \times \mtxns$ is an anti-symmetric, irreflexive relation
and $\mar \subseteq \mtxns \times \mtxns $ is a total, anti-symmetric
order on \txns such that $\mvis \subseteq \mar$, we define the \emph{write
set} of \txns as:
$ [\mtxns]_{\mwri} = \{\mwri(r,f,n) \;|\; \mtxn \vdash
  \mwri(r,f,n),\;
\mtxn \in \mtxns, n \in \Z, r \in \recs, f \in \fields  \} $, which is
the set of all writes to any field and record occured in any of the
executed transactions.

Assuming a total order of operations inside a transaction, \txno, and
a mapping \texttt{TXN()} from operations to their enclosing
transaction, we define a total order of writes within an execution as
follows: 
$$ w_1 \xrightarrow{\mwrio} w_2  \Leftrightarrow \texttt{TXN}(w_1)
\xrightarrow{\mar} \texttt{TXN}(w_2)  \vee w_1 \xrightarrow{\mtxno} w_2$$
We now define the \emph{eventual state} of the given execution,
denoted by $\mevs$, as the set of all writes performed on the database
and the absolute order between them, which is in accordance with the
fact that read operations do not affect the final state\footnote{read operations might 
affect writes indirectly by
providing them with values to be written; however, those values are already
captured in the write operations and it suffices to only include
write operations in our definition}. Formally:
  $$\mevs = ([\mtxns]_{\mwri},\mwrio) $$
Now we are ready to define \es, as our notion of application
correctness:

\begin{definition} 
  An abstract execution $ \mex_1 = (\mtxns, \mvis,\mar)$
  is said to be eventually serializable, if there exists another
  abstract execution $\mex_2$ which is serializable and has the same eventual state, i.e. 
  $\mex_2 \models \Psi_{Ser} $ and $\overset{\rightarrow s}{\mex_1}=
  \overset{\rightarrow s}{\mex_2}$.
\end{definition}
Note that $\mex_2$ in the above definition can theoretically include 
additional read-only transactions or altered transactions containing
additional read operations. However, since serializability is more
difficult to be achieved for executions with extra transactions or
operations, in order to prove a given execution eventually
serializable, the above definition intuitively guides us to first strip  certain
transactions and operations off the original execution and then prove
classic serializability for the trimmed execution.

\subsection {Dangling Reads}
In this part, we will introduce the notion of \emph{dangling reads}
as the ones whose sole purpose is to inform users about the current
state of the database, meaning that the values they return are not used anywhere in
the program (inside the following statements or path conditions). For example,
the \texttt{getBalance} transaction in a banking application contains a
single read operation on
the current balance of a given account, whose output is simply printed on the
user's screen but is not used anywhere else in the transaction.

We define a mapping $\mdang: \mrd \mapsto \texttt{bool}$, to keep
track of read operations that are dangling (which are mapped to
\texttt{false}). Such a mapping can be straightforwardly generated by a
static analysis of the input code
(similar to the dead-code-elimination step in any basic compiler) 
and in fact, we will present our
extended version of such an algorithm in the rest of this section.

Following \cite{Nagar:ser}, in order to detect eventual
serializability violations, we are going to build dependency graphs
form abstract executions and look for cycles. However, as we explained
above, certain operations are harmless against $\es$ and thus, cycles
containing such operations must be excluded from our analysis. 
We define a cycle $C$ to be \emph{effectful}, if and only if,
$\forall (r:\mrd) \in C.\; \zeta(r)$.

\begin{theorem}
  Given an abstract execution $ \mex = (\mtxns,\mvis,\mar)$, if there
  is no effectful cycle in the dependency graph $G_\mex$ then $\mex$ is
  eventually serializable.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{conditionally dangling reads}
The presented notion of dangling reads is already good enough to exclude many
practically harmless violations from our analysis; however, we can
further augment read operations with \emph{conditions} under which
they will become dangling. For example, consider the following transactions
(top)
in the dependency graph (bottom), from the courseware
application \cite{Gotsman:cise}: 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/conditional_dangling.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{a harmless violation}
  \label{fig:dangling}
\end{figure}

The situation in fig.\ref{fig:dangling} is clearly a violation of
classic serializability: $\sigma_1$ witnesses effects of
$\sigma_3$ but not $\sigma_4$ and $\sigma_2$ witnesses effects of
$\sigma_4$ but not $\sigma_3$, which creates a cycle as is depicted.
Moreover, a naive analysis looking for dangling reads would similarly
consider the given case a violation of \es, since values read by both reads
in enroll\_txn are used later inside the transaction and neither is seemingly
dangling. 

However, as acute readers may have noticed, 
the values read in enroll\_txn are subsequently used only under certain conditions.
In other words, the read operations can potentially become dangling
depending on the values they return. Following this observation, the
serializability violation in fig.\ref{fig:dangling} becomes harmless against $\es$ as the
guard ($v_1>0 \;\&\&\; v_2>0 $) can never be satisfied according to other
conditions present in the scenario.


Our goal in this paper, similar to \cite{Nagar:ser}, is to
construct a formula in FOL for a 
given transactional program $\mathbb{T}$ and a consistency
specification $\Psi$, such that any valid abstract execution
$\mex$ of $\mathbb{T}$ under $\Psi$ 
and its dependency
graph $G_\mex$ is a satisfying model of the formula. Consequently, we
can extend $\zeta$ to map each read operation to an FOL formula
(instead of a boolean), specifying the
conditions under which the read values become useful; 
these conditions
can be used later in our final formulation for a more accurate
analysis. 
As like before, $\mdang(\mrd)=\texttt{true}$ (never dangling) and 
$\mdang(\mrd)=\texttt{false}$ (always dangling) are the 
two extreme possible values of the map $\zeta$.

Before presenting our algorithm to statically construct $\zeta$
for a given transactional SQL program $\mathcal{T}$, we first define $\mathsf{src}(\mcmd)$ to be the set
of all read operations from which the values \emph{used} in $\mcmd$ are being sourced. 
Note that a value can be used in any statement and not just in writes, e.g. inside the 
$\where$ clause of a $\select$.
If the values used in $\mcmd$ are all constants or 
the input parameters of the transaction,
$\mathsf{src(\mcmd)}$ would trivially be empty\footnote{
we skip the formal algorithm for
 constructing $\mathsf{src(\mcmd)}$ in this paper,
as it is very straightforward using a simple data-flow analysis}.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Recursive construction of $\mdang$, given a transactional program $\mathcal{T}$, initially called with 
$\varphi = \texttt{true} $} \label{alg:dang} 

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{ExtractDanglig}{$\mcmd$,$\varphi$}
\State \textbf{match} $\mcmd$ \textbf{with}
\State \indent \textbf{case:} $\mcmd_1 \in \stmt{\mathcal{T}}$ 
\State \indent \indent \textbf{for} $\mrd$ \textbf{in} $\mathsf{src(\mcmd_1)}$ \textbf{do}
\State \indent \indent \indent $\mdang(\mrd)\gets \mdang(\mrd) \vee \varphi $
\State \indent \indent \textbf{end}

\State \indent \textbf{case:} $\mcmd_1;\mcmd_2$ 
\State \indent \indent \textsc{ExtractDanglig}($\mcmd_1$,$\varphi$)
\State \indent \indent \textsc{ExtractDanglig}($\mcmd_2$,$\varphi$)
\State \indent \textbf{case:} \texttt{IF} $\phi$ \texttt{THEN} \texttt{c}$_1$ \texttt{ELSE} \texttt{c}$_2$
\State \indent \indent \textsc{ExtractDanglig}($\mcmd_1$,$\varphi \wedge \phi$)
\State \indent \indent \textsc{ExtractDanglig}($\mcmd_2$,$\varphi \wedge \neg \phi$)
\State \indent \textbf{case:} \texttt{FOREACH} \texttt{v}$_1$ \texttt{IN} \texttt{v}$_2$ \texttt{DO} \texttt{c$_1$} \texttt{END}
\State \indent \indent \textsc{ExtractDanglig}($\mcmd_1$,$\varphi$)


\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}



Assuming that $\mdang$ initially maps all read operations to $\mfalse$,
alg.\ref{alg:dang} recursively populates $\mdang$, constructing  a
map from each read operation in $\stmt{\mathcal{T}}$
to a formula made of the disjunction of \texttt{IF} conditionals enclosing
statements which are supplied by a value from that read.




\subsection{FOL Encoding}
In this section, we present our FOL encoding of transactional
program $\mathbb{T}$, as a formula parametric over a consistency specification $\Psi$, such
that any valid execution of $\mathbb{T}$ under $\Psi$ and its 
dependency graph is a satisfying model of the formula. We base our work on all of
the definitions and vocabulary from \cite{Nagar:ser} and present our slightly
modified version of their rules relating transactional programs to dependency
relations. 

As the result of choosing $\es$ as our notion of program correctness, which is weaker than classic
serializability, for each pair of transaction types $\mathcal{T}_1,\mathcal{T}_2
\in \mathbb{T}$ and a dependency type $\recs\in\{\mathsf{WR},\mathsf{RW}\}$,  we modified the 
rules populating $\eta^{\recs\rightarrow,\mathcal{T}_1,\mathcal{T}_2}_{} $ and 
$\eta^{\rightarrow\mathsf{WR},\mathcal{T}_1,\mathcal{T}_2}_{} $ (parametrized
over statements $\mcmd_1$ and $\mcmd_2$, exactly one of which must be a
\texttt{SELECT}), in a way to additionally
incorporate the conditions under which the \texttt{SELECT} statement is not
dangling. 
For example, our version of the rule that constructs the necessary entailments 
of an \textrm{RW} dependency relation is presented in the fig.\ref{fig:rwtus}:


\begin{figure}[h]
	\rulelabel{RW-Update-Select}
	$$
	\RULE
		{\mcmd_1 \equiv \tt{UPDATE\; SET}\; f = e_c\; \tt{WHERE}\; \phi_1 \\ 
		 \mcmd_2 \equiv \tt{SELECT} \; f \;\tt{AS}\; v\; \tt{WHERE}\; \phi_2 \\ 
		 \mcmd_1 \in  \C{Stmts}(\mathcal{T}_1) \quad \mcmd_2 \in  \C{Stmts}(\mathcal{T}_2) \quad \Gamma(t_1) = \mathcal{T}_1 \quad \Gamma(t_2) = \mathcal{T}_2}
		{ \eta_{\mcmd_2, \mcmd_1}^{\F{RW}\rightarrow,\mathcal{T}_2,\mathcal{T}_1}(t_2, t_1) =  
		 (\exists r.\ 
		 \mathcal{V}(\llbracket \Lambda_{\mathcal{T}_1}(\mcmd_1) \rrbracket_{t_1}) 
		  \wedge \mathcal{V}(\llbracket \phi_1 \rrbracket_{t_1, r} ) 
		 \; \wedge  \\ \myQQuad{5} \mathcal{V}(\llbracket  \Lambda_{\mathcal{T}_2}(\mcmd_2) \rrbracket_{t_2}) 
	    	\wedge \mathcal{V}(\llbracket \phi_2 \rrbracket_{t_2, r}) 
		 \; \wedge \\ \myQQuad{7}\C{Alive}(r, t_1)  \wedge \F{RW}(r, \F{f}, t_2, t_1)
 				\color{red} 
					\wedge \mathcal{V}(\llbracket  \zeta_{\mathcal{T}_2}(\mcmd_2) \rrbracket_{t_2}) 

 				\color{black})
	
}
